# GPT-2 Training Script Development

This task has been done as a part of application for AI roles at SuperAGI.
## Introduction

A training script for the GPT-2 model. This endeavor has been an enlightening journey, providing deep insights into the complexities of language model training. 

## Overview of the Script

This Python-based training script leverages the robust PyTorch framework alongside Hugging Face's Transformers, aiming to fine-tune the GPT-2 model efficiently. The script's key features include:

- **Model Configuration**: A dataclass is utilized for GPT-2 configurations, allowing for versatile model parameter adjustments.
- **Custom Dataset Integration**: Supports diverse dataset formats, including file-based and Hugging Face datasets.
- **Gradient Checkpointing**: Facilitates memory-efficient training, a critical aspect for managing large models like GPT-2.
- **Optimized Training Loop**: Incorporates the Accelerate library to streamline CPU/GPU and distributed training processes.

## Important Reminder

- **Accelerator Configuration**: Ensure to configure the accelerator by running `accelerate init` in the command line before starting the training process. This step is crucial for optimal hardware utilization.

## Notable Learnings and Decisions

- **AdamW Optimizer**: The adoption of AdamW, an optimizer with a weight decay fix, is pivotal. It provides more effective L2 regularization than traditional Adam, enhancing training stability and model generalization.
- **Learning Rate Scheduler**: A cosine decay learning rate scheduler was implemented, optimizing learning rate adjustments throughout the training cycle for superior model performance.
- **Weight Initialization and Tying**: Includes strategic weight initialization and optional weight tying, which can reduce the model's parameter count and improve performance in language modeling tasks.
- **Reproducibility with Seed Setting**: Ensures consistent and replicable results across different runs by setting a random seed, a vital aspect for credible machine learning experimentation.
- **Gradient Accumulation**: Employs gradient accumulation to manage large batches on limited hardware, enabling effective training with larger batch sizes.

## Challenges and Resolutions

- **Memory Management**: Addressed the high memory demands of GPT-2 through gradient checkpointing and optimal batch sizing, enhancing GPU memory utilization.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Extensive experimentation was conducted to identify the optimal hyperparameter set, focusing on the balance between learning rate, batch size, and epoch count.

## Conclusion

This project has significantly broadened my understanding of NLP models and their underlying complexities. It has been an amalgamation of theoretical knowledge and practical challenges, offering invaluable insights into deep learning and AI.
